## Description

This project implements a HealthCare Chatbot for disease detection based on symptoms. The chatbot utilizes machine learning algorithms, particularly Decision Trees and Support Vector Classification (SVC), for disease prediction. It analyzes user-reported symptoms to identify potential diseases and provides relevant recommendations.

## Features

1. *Symptom Analysis*: Users can input their symptoms, and the chatbot will analyze them to identify potential diseases.

2. *Recommendations*: The chatbot provides recommendations based on the identified diseases, including precautions and possible treatments.

3. *User-Friendly Interface*: The chatbot is designed with a user-friendly interface to facilitate easy interaction and understanding.

## Usage

1. Launch the chatbot application.
2. Enter the symptoms you are experiencing when prompted.
3. Follow the chatbot's instructions to provide additional information if necessary.
4. Receive disease predictions and recommendations from the chatbot.

## Dataset

The project utilizes a dataset containing symptom-disease mappings for disease prediction. The dataset is included in this repository (https://github.com/codewithsomi/Symptom-Based-Disease-Prediction-Chatbot-Using-NLP/tree/main/Data) and can be obtained from sources like kaggle. 

## Model Architecture

The disease detection model is built using machine learning algorithms, specifically Decision Trees and Support Vector Classification (SVC). It analyzes user-reported symptoms to predict potential diseases based on learned patterns.

## Future Work

1. Enhance the chatbot's accuracy by incorporating more comprehensive symptom-disease mappings.
2. Integrate additional features such as user history tracking and personalized recommendations.
3. Deploy the chatbot as a web or mobile application for broader accessibility.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while running the chatbot, try the following troubleshooting steps:

1. Check that all dependencies are properly installed.
2. Ensure that the dataset is accessible and formatted correctly.
3. Verify that the chatbot application is using the correct input/output channels.
